        <p>
            My name is Charlie, known online as _cyxhe. Composer, developer, instrument creator, and classically trained pianist based in Los Angeles, exploring the intersection between music, science, and technology.

        <p>
            I write orchestral music that blends traditional ensembles with modern melodies.
            Alongside conventional composition, I build tools that make it easy to explore sound, like my first web application, Overtone Lab.
            I also design custom physically modeled instruments and additive synthesizers as an extension of my interests and studies in physics.
        </p>

            My journey in music began at a young age, when I began to play the piano.
            Classical piano training continued through high school, and I eventually passed both the Ceritifcate of Merit Level Advanced and ABRSM Grade 8 Performance Exams.
            In middle school, I joined the string orchestra, when I started writing arrangements of classical and film music, which I conducted during concerts.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            I began to write original music the summer before high school. Since then, I have completed two large orchestral works.
            I've also begun to experiment with the science of sound, exploring synthesizers and the digital side of music, as well as creating my own unique synthesized instruments.
